<h2>Usage notebooks</h2>
<p>
  Here, we present different examples of processing and analyses using PRESCIENT
  using longitudinal scRNA-seq data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1168-5">Veres et al. 2019</a>
  as an example dataset. This will be a growing list of notebooks as we add functionality and update PRESCIENT.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To run the following notebooks with the example data, download the following directories containing raw data and trained PRESCIENT models:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mz94yu0yjgvcp0i/AACAlnUQcr5BQBntJtHQSrkda?dl=1">Download training data</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o4897lyxh4189v3/AAB2Ek2ahtGkdDkHiByGBtaya?dl=1">Download trained PRESCIENT models</a></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Estimating growth rates.</h3>
<p>
PRESCIENT models can incorporate proliferation during training.
This was shown to greatly improve model performance, and we conclude that growth is
important for model performance. To estimate growth, you need
Here, growth gene sets are provided in the downloaded data folder and used in the notebook, but you
can use any gene set (gst) from common sources like <a href=""></a>

</ul>
<p>This functionality will soon be available via the command line interface.</p>


<!-- <h3>Visualizing potential landscape from trained models</h3>
<p>
Once the PRESCIENT model has been trained with the above command, you can visualize the vector field and
  potential function of the learned differentiation landscape. The following notebook shows how to do that
  using built in PRESCIENT commands.

<h3>Simulating cells and visualizing animated trajectories</h3>
<p>
  With a trained PRESCIENT model it is possible to simulate single-cells forward in time with arbitrary initializations.
  The following notebook shows how to simulate single cells and visualize trajectories as an animation.
