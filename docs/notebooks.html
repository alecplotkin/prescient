<h2>Usage notebooks</h2>
<p>
  Here, we present different examples of various individual pre-processing and analyses steps using PRESCIENT. This will be a growing list of notebooks as we add functionality and update PRESCIENT.
  <br>
  To demonstrate, we use longitudinal scRNA-seq data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1168-5">Veres et al. 2019</a> Stage 5 pancreatic
  beta-cell differentiation as an example dataset.
  To run the following notebooks with the example data, download the following directories containing raw data and trained PRESCIENT models:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mz94yu0yjgvcp0i/AACAlnUQcr5BQBntJtHQSrkda?dl=1">Download training data</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o4897lyxh4189v3/AAB2Ek2ahtGkdDkHiByGBtaya?dl=1">Download trained PRESCIENT models</a></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Estimating growth rates.</h3>
<div class="list-group-item list-group-item-action home-list-item" style="background-color: FloralWhite">
  <p>
    PRESCIENT models can incorporate proliferation during training via computing a "growth weight" per cell in a scRNA-seq dataset.
    This was shown to greatly improve model performance, and we conclude that growth is important for model performance. When lineage tracing is available, empirical growth rates can be computed, however since the primary
    use case for PRESCIENT is in the absence of lineage tracing, we provide a function for estimating growth from proliferative/death gene signatures.
    Here, these gene sets are provided in the downloaded data folder and used in the notebook, but you
    can use any gene set (gst) from common sources like <a href="http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp">MSigDB</a>.

<!-- <h3>Visualizing potential landscape from trained models</h3>
<p>
Once the PRESCIENT model has been trained with the above command, you can visualize the vector field and
  potential function of the learned differentiation landscape. The following notebook shows how to do that
  using built in PRESCIENT commands.

</ul>

<h3>Simulating cells and visualizing animated trajectories</h3>
<p>
  With a trained PRESCIENT model it is possible to simulate single-cells forward in time with arbitrary initializations.
  The following notebook shows how to simulate single cells and visualize trajectories as an animation.

<p>You can simulate cells via the command line interface.</p> -->
